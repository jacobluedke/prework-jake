        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p>
            Jermaine Lamarr Cole, or J. Cole as he is known professionally, was born on January 28th, 1985 on an American military base in Frankfurt,
            West Germany. After his father abandoned the family, his mother moved him and his brother to Fayetteville, North Carolina. Growing up, he
            enjoyed basketball and music growing up and was first-chair violinist for the Terry Sanford Orchestra until 2003. 
        </p>

        <p>
            He started rapping at the age of twelve and in 2000 wanted to make it a career. After graduating high school with a 4.2 GPA, Cole moved to
            New York City with a scholarship to St. Johnâ€™s University with an initial major in computer science. He graduated magna cum laude in 2007 
            with a 3.8 GPA.
        </p>

        <p>
            With musical inspiration from Andre 3000, Nas, Tupac and Eminem, Cole and his cousin worked hard to master rhyming and wordplay. By the age 
            of 14, he had numerous notebooks filled with lyrical ideas and over the next three years added the jumbled mess of rhymes to beats and made
            them into songs.
        </p>

        <p>
            He has won 8 BET Awards, three Soul Train Music Awards, a Billboard Music Award, and a Grammy and has been nominated for other awards numerous
            times. He currently has 7 gold records and 5 certified platinum albums and is continuously releasing new music. He has since worked with many 
            well known artists including the following:
            
            <ul>
                <li>Jay-Z</li>
                <li>Bas</li>
                <li>Kendrick Lamar</li>
                <li>Miguel</li>
                <li>Wale</li>
            </ul>
